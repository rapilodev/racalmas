A project consists of one or more studios.

A user can execute different actions depending on the permissions the user has for the selected project and studio.

== Permissions
A user can be assigned to different roles for a selected project and studio
(for example Guest, Editor, Program Scheduler, Studio Manager).
A role is a set of selected permissions.
It is possible to define new roles and assign them to selected users.

Each user should get only the permissions he or she really needs.
This eases using the system, due to a user only sees the actions that are assigned to the role.
It can prevent failures, for example deleting a broadcast the user is not assigned to.

By assigning roles to users the workflow can be done by multiple users with different roles.
For example one can schedule the program, while editors can fill in the content for their broadcasts.

Permissions of an user can be individually set for each project and studio.

== Users

At the menu Users you can edit the user accounts.
User accounts can be locked or deleted, one can edit the email address and assign roles to the user account.

All editors of a series can edit the broadcasts of a series.

== Schedule

schedule dates allow to schedule broadcasts without separately creating single broadcasts for a series.
Schedule dates can be created, moved or deleted in a single step.

Schedule dates can be single dates or recurring dates. Both have to be inside the time slots of the project and studio.

Schedule dates are displayed in the calendar. One can create a broadcasts from an existing schedule date only. This should be done if the schedule date has been confirmed to avoid unneccessary editing of the date.
